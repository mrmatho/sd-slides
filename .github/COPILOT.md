# sd-slides — Copilot guidance

This file gives quick, practical instructions for working on this Slidev project and example prompts you can use with Copilot.

## Project snapshot

- Framework: Slidev (Vue 3)
- Entry slide file: `slides.md`
- Sections (slide fragments / notes): `pages/`
- Reusable Vue components: `components/`
- Snippets / helper code: `snippets/`
- Deployment configs: `netlify.toml`, `vercel.json`

## Quick commands (PowerShell)

Run these from the project root (Windows PowerShell / pwsh):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev    # start Slidev locally and open the browser
npm run build  # build static site for production
npm run export # export slides to PDF/images
```

Scripts come from `package.json` and use the installed Slidev CLI.

## Where to edit

- Add links to new markdown files in `slides.md`, using `src: ./pages/your_page.md` to include them.
- Sections of the presentation go in `pages/*.md` — each file can hold slide fragments or whole sections and can be included with Slidev's `---` separators.
- The first slide for each section should have `hideInToc: false` so it appears in the table of contents.
- Vue components live in `components/` and can be imported into slide markdown using a `<script setup>` block.

Example: import and use a component in a slide markdown file

```markdown
<script setup>
import Counter from '../components/Counter.vue'
</script>

<Counter />
```

## Editing conventions & tips

- Keep slides short — one idea per slide.
- Prefer small, focused components in `components/` so slides stay simple.
- Use `snippets/external.ts` for shared helper functions or sample code used across slides.
- If you add dependencies, update `package.json` and run `npm install`.

## Deploying

- This repo includes `netlify.toml` and `vercel.json`. Either provider can host the built static output from `npm run build`.
- Typical flow: run `npm run build` then publish the resulting `dist` (or `.output`) folder per host instructions.

## Common Copilot prompts (examples)

- "Add a new slide section about constraints in `slides.md` with 5 slides and speaker notes."
- "Create a new Vue component `AlertBox.vue` in `components/` that accepts `type` and `message` props and show an example usage in `slides.md`."
- "Refactor `snippets/external.ts` to export a typed function and add a short unit test." (If you want tests, say which test runner you prefer.)
- "Generate a printable PDF-friendly export configuration for Slidev and add it to `README.md`."

## Troubleshooting

- If `npm run dev` fails, check that `node` and `npm` are installed and that dependencies were installed without errors.
- If a component doesn't render in a slide, ensure the import path is correct and the component has a default export.
- Check for closing tags in markdown (e.g. unclosed code blocks or HTML tags).

## Available Layouts


## Quality gates (recommended)

- Build: `npm run build` — should complete without errors.
- Lint/Types: add a linter or TypeScript config if needed.
- Tests: none by default — consider adding a small test harness if you introduce shared logic in `snippets/`.
