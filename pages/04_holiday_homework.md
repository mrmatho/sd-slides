# Holiday Homework

::content::

The holiday homework for this unit is a set of Python basics exercises to make sure you are prepared and ready to take on the rest of the course.

We will be continuing with the exercises once the year starts. 

[Github Exercise Repository - https://github.com/mrmatho/sd25_python_exercises/](https://github.com/mrmatho/sd25_python_exercises/)


<Admonition color="blue-light" title="Instructions" class="ns-c-tight">

1.  Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
2. Go to the exercise repository linked above and choose "Use this template" to create your own copy of the repository. 
3. Add mrmatho as a collaborator to your repository so that I can see your work.
4. Open VS Code and clone your repository to your computer.
5. Work through **Exercise 01 and Exercise 02** in the repository.
6. Commit and push your changes to GitHub regularly so that your work is saved online.
7. Use the Testing extension in VS Code to run the Pytest tests provided. 

</Admonition>

If you have a test that isn't working - keep trying, but better to come back with the work incomplete than using AI to solve everything. Ask AI questions, but not for solutions.

# Holiday Homework (if Git didn't work for you)

::content::

If you were unable to get Git and GitHub working, you can still complete the holiday homework by downloading the exercise files directly.

As long as Python is working on your computer, you can have a go at the exercises.

**Remember to ask for help in the first week of term if you couldn't get Git working!**

1. Download the exercise files as a ZIP from [this link](https://github.com/mrmatho/sd25_python_exercises/)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. Open VS Code and open the extracted folder.
4. Work through **Exercise 01 and Exercise 02** in the repository.
5. If you have been able to install pytest, use the Testing extension in VS Code to run the tests provided.

# Help!!

::content::

- Each folder has a `README.md` file with instructions for the exercises. 
  - If you view the files in GitHub, they will show as nicely formatted web pages.
  - The READMEs include "📚 Required Knowledge" sections that have an explanation of the Python you need to know
- The slides we just went through cover all the important parts you need. 
- Do a Google Search for the specific python topic you need help with. There are lots of tutorials and explanations online.

<Admonition title="Still Stuck?" color="orange-light">

Write down your question and have it ready for our first lesson. A question about a specific problem will make me very happy.

Then move on and try the next part: one problem shouldn't stop you from making progress!
