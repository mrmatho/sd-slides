<Admonition color="blue-light" title="From the Study Design">

***reasons why individuals and organisations undertake software development projects, including:***

- increasing productivity and efficiency
- reducing costs
- identifying opportunities to address gaps in the market
- meeting organisational objectives or needs

</Admonition>

Without needing to commit to any of these ideas - in your groups, identify a project idea that would meet one of the above reasons.
