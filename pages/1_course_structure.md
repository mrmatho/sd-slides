# Course Structure and Assessment - Unit 3

::left::

## Area of Study 1: Programming

**SAC: 20%**

- Module 1: Simple calculations using logical and conditional operators (60 mins, 10 marks)
- Module 2: Reading and writing files (60 mins, 10 marks)
- Module 3: Sorting and searching in a GUI (180 mins, 30 marks)
- Module 4: Classes and objects in a GUI (180 mins, 30 marks)

Each module is assessed through a practical programming task, following a given requirements and design specification. You will be required to write, document and test a working program to meet those specifications.

## Area of Study 2: Analysis and Design

**SAT: 30%**

- Project brief and project plan (Gantt Chart)
- Analytical tools to show interactions between systems, users, data and networks
- Analysis that defines requirements, constraints and scope of a solution a Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Folio of design ideas
- Final detailed design specifications of preferred design

The SAT project is the big piece of work for the whole year. In Semester 1 (Unit 3) you will complete the analysis and design phase.

# Course Structure and Assessment - Unit 4

::left::
## Area of Study 1: Development and Evaluation

**SAT: 30%**
- A software solution that meets the software requirements specification (SRS)
- Preparation and conduction of beta testing
- Evaluation of the solution and assessment of the effectiveness of the project plan

In Semester 2 (Unit 4) you will complete the development and evaluation phase of the SAT project. You will build the solution you designed in Unit 3, test it and evaluate how well it meets the requirements.

::right::

## Area of Study 2: Software Development

**SAC: 20%**

Exam style assessment using a case study to:
- analyse an organisation's software development practices
- identify and evaluate security controls
- identify and evaluate threats to software development practices
- make recommendations to improve practices

The SAC is a written exam style assessment based on a case study. You will be required to answer a series of questions based on the case study. This closely mirrors the style of questions you will see in the end of year exam.

# What do you mean by "Git"?

::left::

Git is a **version control system** that tracks changes to files over time. 

It allows projects to:
- Track changes to files
- Collaborate with others
- Revert to previous versions of files
- **Branch** and **merge** changes*
- Maintain a history of changes

::right::

\* **Branching** allows you to create a separate line of development in your project. This is useful for working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

</SpeechBubble>

<br>

<SpeechBubble color="cyan-light" position="l" shape="round">

\* **Merging** is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. Once your changes are complete and tested, you can merge them back into the main branch.

<Admonition title="GitHub">

*GitHub* is a web-based platform that **hosts** Git repositories. We'll use GitHub to store your code (as well as my code) as part of our software development workflow and to allow me to see your progress.
