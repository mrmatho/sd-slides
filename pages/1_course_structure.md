## Area of Study 2: Software Development

**SAC: 20%**

Exam style assessment using a case study to:
- analyse an organisation's software development practices
- identify and evaluate security controls
- identify and evaluate threats to software development practices
- make recommendations to improve practices

The SAC is a written exam style assessment based on a case study. You will be required to answer a series of questions based on the case study. This closely mirrors the style of questions you will see in the end of year exam.
