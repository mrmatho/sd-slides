# Your Project

::content::

## Start thinking about:

- What kind of data interests you?
- Who would use your application?
- What features would they need?
- How would they interact with the data?

<Admonition color="blue-light" title="Remember">

Keep it simple! A well-executed basic CRUD app is better than an overly ambitious incomplete project.

</Admonition>

<Admonition color="orange" title="Extendability">

A good CRUD app could be extended later, once base functionality is working. Extension ideas include:

- Data search, filtering or sorting functionality
- User authentication
- Exporting data (e.g., to CSV, PDF)
